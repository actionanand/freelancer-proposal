            <p>Dear {{ proposal.customer | titlecase}},</p>
            <p>Itâ€™s a my pleasure to meeting you and reviewing your project requirements, 
                I believe it is a great fit for the types of applications that I build out. 
                Please feel free to check out some of my past projects
            <a href="{{ proposal.portfolio_url }}" target="_blank">here</a> </p>
            <p>To successfully build out the application I will be utilizing {{ proposal.tools }},
                    and a number of other tools to ensure that the project follows industry wide best practices.</p>
            <p>Ensuring that you are fully informed is one of my top priorities, so in addition to incorporating 
                everything that we discussed, I will also be creating a project management dashboard and sending you 
                a project update message daily so that you can have a transparent view of the development as it takes place.</p>
            <p>To accomplish the project and meet the requirements that we discussed, I am estimating that it will 
                take {{ proposal.estimated_hours }} hours in development time to complete. The project should 
                take {{ proposal.weeks_to_complete }} weeks to complete and with my hourly rate of
                {{ proposal.hourly_rate | currency:'&#x20b9;':'symbol' }}, the estimated total will be
                {{ proposal.hourly_rate * proposal.estimated_hours | currency:'&#x20b9;':'symbol' }} (Indian Rupee). </p>
            <p>The next step from here is to set up a meeting to finalize the project and sign contracts. </p>
            <p>I am excited for this opportunity to send you this proposal and I look forward to working with you!</p>
